## Understanding Crypto Brute Force with [Your Tool Name]

[Your Tool Name] employs brute force techniques to explore the vast landscape of crypto wallets. It generates potential wallet addresses based on algorithms like [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, as well as [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) for Ethereum and other EVM chains.

It then either compares these generated addresses against pre-built databases of known addresses or checks the balances in real-time. The C++ engine is designed for speed and efficiency when exploring all possible wallet combinations.

## Why [Your Tool Name] for Brute Force?

Unlike many Python-based brute force tools, **[Your Tool Name]** is engineered using C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage. This delivers up to **10x faster** performance, which is essential when exploring the vastness of the crypto space. Whether you're researching wallet structures, attempting wallet recovery, or analyzing security vulnerabilities, [Your Tool Name] delivers both speed and power.

## Features ‚Äì Your Brute Force Toolkit

-   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Generation:** Create wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, and many other cryptocurrencies.
-   **Brute Force Balance Detection:** Search for wallets that currently contain a balance.
-   **Algorithm Compatibility:** Supports both Keccak256 for EVM wallets and BIP39, BIP44, and Bech32 for Bitcoin, providing flexibility.
-   **Database Optimization:** Download and use pre-built databases to dramatically speed up your brute-force searches.
-   **High-Speed Performance:** Designed to leverage your CPU and GPU for maximum performance.
-   **Bitcoin Wallet Recovery:** Bitcoin wallet recovery by utilizing a seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

## Supported Blockchains

-   Bitcoin (BTC)
-   Ethereum (ETH)
-   Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
-   Any EVM-compatible chain

## Brute Force in Action: How to Search

**[Your Tool Name]** allows you to use brute-force to uncover wallets with existing balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Brute Force:

*   Method 1: Use the program menu. This method checks via the internet and *may* be slower.
*   Method 2: Use the database. Faster.

### EVM Wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Method 1: Search through blockchain explorers.
*   Method 2: Use the database. Faster.

### Important Considerations:

*   Search speed is highly dependent on your GPU. Consider running multiple instances of the program (1-4, depending on your hardware) to accelerate the process.
*   Utilizing databases significantly speeds up the brute force.

## Success! - What to do next?

When **[Your Tool Name]** identifies a wallet with a balance:

*   The program will **halt immediately**.
*   The wallet details will be **displayed** in the console.
*   The information will be **saved** in ``found_wallets.txt``.

### How to Access the Funds (Ethically)

1.  Import the **seed phrase** from the found wallet into a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Electrum).
2.  You can then transfer the funds to your own wallet.

> **Remember:** If you find a wallet with funds, please consider sharing a small portion of the balance as a thank you to the developer!

## Recovering Bitcoin with [Your Tool Name]

[Your Tool Name] also offers a Bitcoin wallet recovery feature:

### How It Works:

*   Enter your mnemonic phrase.
*   Missing words can be represented using the asterisk (*).

![recovery](/img/archive.webp)

### Important Recommendations:

*   The seed phrase must have 12 words.
*   Use the * symbol.
*   Recovering Bitcoin with a brute-force method may take time.
*   The program will stop if it finds a valid wallet.
